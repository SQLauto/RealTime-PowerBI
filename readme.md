===

A simple example to show how one can use [Power BI](http://www.powerbi.com) REST [API](http://docs.powerbi.apiary.io) to create Real-Time Dashboard both using API directly or via [Azure Event Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/) and [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/stream-analytics/).

This version has also been used at the [SQL Saturday #460](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/460) in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on December 2015. Here you can find the accompanying slide deck:
